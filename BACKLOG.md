# Prioritized Backlog (Top 12)

1. GPU pool: NVENC/VAAPI feature detection + scheduling labels
2. Full TUS support + browser resumable client examples
3. DRM/restricted detection hardening with yt-dlp exit codes + stderr parsing
4. Stronger metadata preservation across transcodes (timecode, GPS) per container support
5. Stream ingestion robustness: RTSP reconnect, jitter buffers, partial_success semantics
6. Advanced packaging: HLS/DASH outputs + multi-bitrate ladders
7. Content validation: black frames/audio silence detection + warnings
8. Per-tenant quotas, billing hooks (Stripe), and project-level rate limits
9. Object lifecycle policies: automatic expiry, transition to cold storage
10. Cluster-friendly temp storage: local SSD vs PVC + eviction handling
11. More fixtures + expanded “20 inputs” canonical suite
12. SRE automation: debug bundle upload, one-click repro script generation
